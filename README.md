### Key Notes:
1. **Images**: Replace the `./images/stock-website-demo.png`, `./images/stock-chart-demo.png`, `./images/homepage-demo.png`, and `./images/kpi-chart.png` with actual images you want to showcase from your project. You can either upload these images to the GitHub repository or use URLs if the images are hosted elsewhere.
   
2. **Visuals**: The images will enhance the README by providing a visual context for your project, making it more engaging for visitors.

3. **Image Directory**: Make sure that the images are either placed in a folder named `images` within the project or update the paths accordingly to where the images are stored.

This should give a more comprehensive and visually engaging README for your stock price prediction website. Let me know if you'd like to make any further adjustments!
